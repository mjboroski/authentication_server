Each application requires​ a README​. Please ensure the README​ includes the following
components:  

 ● Which application you choose to develop and why  
    I chose to create an authentication server. It includes the back-end API, as well as an applicable accompanying front-end.  
  
  ● How to use/test​ the provided application  
    To use this, fork and clone the repo. Make sure node is installed on your system.  
    In the terminal, go to the server folder, npm install, and type "npm start". This will start the server.  
    Then open a second terminal, go to the client folder, npm install, and type "npm start". The front-end should load in your browser.  
    In the event the front-end doesn't load, navigate to localhost:8080  
      
  ● What Operating System (+ service pack) and libraries are required  
    Node and NPM are required.    
    
  ● Any design decisions or behavioral clarifications​ that illustrate how your program
functions and why  
  To be clear, the server is an API, while the front-end is it's own webpage. This allows for universality.  
  
  ● If you use any external libraries or code-snippets, you must ​provide the following
  information for each (credit must be given to others):​  
   Thanks to Jason Watmore for his expertise on these issues, creating a design that is not only funtional, but clean and utilizing best practices.
